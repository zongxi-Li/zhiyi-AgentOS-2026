# OScode Context Compaction

Independent TypeScript engine, adapted from DeepSeek Harness MIT mechanisms. It has no Session, Cordis, AgentOS, scheduler, DB, Provider credentials, tool execution, or HTTP server.

```powershell
cd apps/agentOS/src/oscode-context
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run benchmark
```

Node >=24.9 is required. Node runs TypeScript directly; there is no generated runtime bundle. `src/index.ts` is the standalone API. Inject `Summarize` to replace the Provider independently. `src/worker.ts` is only a request-scoped JSON-lines adapter.

## Integration

OScode's Python Chat API opts into `RunConfig.call_model_input_filter`. The default shared Tool Runtime path does not opt in. The Python adapter checks a UTF-8 upper bound for cheap short-request admission, then lazily starts one child process per active Runner when needed. That process is closed in the Runner's finalizer. It is not a resident service. Credentials stay in Python; the child receives only source data, schemas, model budgets and summary results.

The TS worker emits `summarize` RPC; Python calls the existing `generate_with_runtime_model` with no tools, disabled thinking and an explicit output cap. The summary call never uses Runner or this input filter. Existing API/SSE/Provider contracts remain unchanged.

## Manual `/compact`

In OScode, type `/compact` and send, or type `/` and choose the command suggestion. The command is handled locally rather than becoming a user message or starting a tool run. The UI displays progress, estimated before/after Token counts, or a no-op/failure explanation.

`POST /ai/chat/compact` uses the current conversation and model settings. It invokes the same TS engine with `force=true`. Completed turns, including the latest completed turn, may be summarized; a current request, unfinished tool group, system/developer messages and multimodal boundaries stay protected. Automatic compaction retains its configured recent-turn policy. Original stored and displayed chat records are retained.

Manual summary budgets are relative to replaceable history after fixed/protected input and checkpoint overhead are accounted for. If useful savings cannot fit a minimal summary, `unchanged` with `INSUFFICIENT_SAVINGS` is returned without calling the Provider. `no_safe_range` with `NO_COMPLETED_HISTORY` means no completed span can safely be replaced. Schema, budget and Provider failures have separate `failureCode` values and retain the original history. An oversized structured summary gets at most one measured rewrite, within the existing total summary-call budget; JSON is never truncated. UTF-8 allowance units are explicitly distinguished from the Provider's output-token cap.

The Python host requests JSON Object output when the selected Provider declares that capability.
The prompt includes the exact eight-field JSON Schema. Invalid structure, incomplete JSON, empty
content and oversized summaries share a single bounded correction attempt using the original source;
this does not retry the Runner or tools, and still counts against the global summary-call budget.
The default summary allowance is 8192 meter units (UTF-8 bytes with the conservative fallback).
It is still limited by the replaceable-history savings target and remaining context capacity.
Provider output capacity is not reduced by a measured byte ratio during correction: those units
are different, and doing so could truncate an otherwise complete JSON object.
The engine also accepts one complete enclosing JSON code fence for compatibility; it never extracts
objects from surrounding prose or accepts truncated JSON. All eight summary fields and the measured
size still pass the same validation. A checkpoint remains an untrusted `user` message, not a system
instruction. The SDK journal adapter recognizes this exact checkpoint envelope separately from
original user turns, restores the full confirmed protocol tail for retained turns, and leaves the
original archive unchanged. A successful summary alone is not sufficient evidence of delivery:
integration tests also run the next two SDK turns with the actual engine-produced projection.

Validated projections are held in the current page's Chat store and supplied as `context` on later streaming/text requests, with new complete messages appended. They are scoped to the conversation and model settings; source-prefix edits invalidate them. Switching conversations discards late results. Refreshing the page restores full raw context; there is no durable checkpoint database or cross-device sync.

The UI distinguishes the previous execution's Provider usage (which includes its temporary tool loop) from the next request's text-history estimate. The latter counts the actual checkpoint plus subsequent messages using the host's conservative UTF-8 allowance and fixed instruction/tool-schema allowance. New user input will be added to that estimate. Model/role changes invalidate the estimate; older history without allowance metadata is labelled as previous-call usage. Fixed allowance metadata travels in existing usage events and is retained by the Node backend for history reloads.

`OSCODE_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_MANUAL_ENABLED=true` enables this explicit endpoint independently of the automatic flag. Set it to `false` to disable manual requests. Model budgets, tokenizer assets and Node requirements below also apply to manual compaction. Restart the Python AI service after adding this route/configuration; Java uses its existing authenticated generic proxy.

## Automatic configuration (default OFF)

`OSCODE_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_ENABLED=false` is the default. No deployment or runtime setting is changed by PR-CTX-01.

Optional model overrides use `OSCODE_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_MODELS`, a JSON object keyed by exact `base_url::effective_model`:

```json
{
  "https://api.deepseek.com::deepseek-flash": {
    "output_reserve": 4096,
    "safety_margin": 1024,
    "trigger_ratio": 0.85,
    "target_ratio": 0.65,
    "retain_turns": 2,
    "retain_ratio": 0.2,
    "summary_max_tokens": 8192,
    "max_summary_calls": 16
  }
}
```

A known Provider model's declared context window is used. An unknown model must explicitly declare `context_window`; there is no guessed global window. `output_reserve` becomes the actual main SDK request cap. For an exact local model tokenizer, additionally configure both `tokenizer_json` and `tokenizer_config` asset paths for that route. No asset is downloaded implicitly. `OSCODE_CONTEXT_COMPACTION_NODE` optionally names the Node executable.

Content is tokenized with a matching configured tokenizer, or OpenAI `js-tiktoken` for supported OpenAI models. Otherwise UTF-8 bytes form a conservative text allowance. Framing/tools and multimodal image placeholders remain estimated; `wireTokenCountExact=false` is always explicit. This implementation does NOT claim exact Provider wire counts. Image placeholders are conservative configured assumptions, not a visual-token endpoint; production multimodal calibration is still needed.

## Safety and current limits

- Original chat history is never overwritten or deleted. Only model input is projected.
- System/developer instructions, current user input, recent dialogue, active tool groups and multimodal references remain protected. Complete tool results can undergo marked deterministic head/tail pruning; errors and structured references are preserved.
- Orphan/duplicate tool IDs are rejected. Compaction cuts move to balanced complete-turn boundaries. No unfinished tool group is summarized.
- Structured summaries are lower-priority `user` background data, never new system instructions. Prompt injection inside historical data must not be executed.
- Protected old multimodal/opaque messages form hard range boundaries; a protected span that alone exceeds the budget fails explicitly instead of being cut.
- Summary schema, length, shrink target and source revision are validated before projection. Within the hard input limit, summary failure returns the entire original input with an explicit failure status/log. Over-limit failure blocks the request, retaining history.
- Hysteresis and an eight-entry request-local memo avoid repeated same-prefix summary calls inside a tool loop. Automatic projections have no cross-request cache; explicit manual checkpoints can be reused by the same page. No DB migration is introduced.
- DSH's Session journal, durable shadow events, distributed locks, route-usage calibration, automatic overflow retry, and tool-schema prefix-cache replay are not migrated. The OScode command is a host integration; this remains an algorithm adaptation/function extraction, not a verbatim package migration.
